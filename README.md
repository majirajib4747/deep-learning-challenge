Whole exercise is been coded in Jupyter Notebook . 
Starter code contains initial model with 2 Layers ( with 80 and 30 neurons) and relu activation model. Output Layer has Sigmoid Activation.  Model Accuracy is 73% and Loss is 55%
Optimization Model 1 Has 3 Layers ( Extra 3rd Layer with 30 Neurons). It has same Accuracy and Loss
Optimization Model 2 has greater epochs=150 ( from 100) . Almost same Accuacy and Loss. 
Optimization Model 3 has another extra Layer ( with 30 Neurons) , but still has same Accuracy and Loss.
All 4 Model been loaded to GIT. 
Summary : As this dataset has many features, decision Tree might give better result
